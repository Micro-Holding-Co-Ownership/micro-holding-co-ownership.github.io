# Value Proposition

### MODEL - first draft

**START**
1. Nina 100% points
2. List tasks done so far -  deliverables
3. Criteria for measuring value 
4. Distribute shares
5. Share criteria with others


**PROCESS OF VOTING WITH SHARES**

**One-time task**
1. Task - Everyone an create a task
2. Negotiations - We need to set the Price (% of shares) and Deliverables  for this task -  debatable (person himself or others)
3. Contract - set the rules who pays, how much each, and when (now or after the task is done)
4. Payment - the person who created a task, gets shares

**Ongoing task**
1. Task - Everyone an create a task
2. Interval - we set execution interval
3. Negotiations - We need to set the Price (% of shares) and Deliverables per each interval -  debatable (person himself or others)
4. Contract - subscription  that can be cancelled  at the end of each interval/supporters can bail out
5. Payment


**MEMBERSHIP FEE**
1. Every member pays % for each share she/he owns
2. We vote on amount of membership fee (median of all given votes) - whenever there is a change, new median is applied and users are notified
3. The whole amount is distributed equally to each member (service fee)


**Feedback/Upgrade:**
- opt-out/veto from the payment
